            <h2>In this edition, we provide a vivid review of Enviro-Week. Picture this: the rhythmic sound of paddles cutting through the water as students kayak under a clear blue sky, the air filled with excitement and camaraderie. For the eighth-grade students, the ropes course offered an unforgettable challenge. Imagine the thrill of their voices as they encouraged one another from the treetops, a symphony of laughter and determination. This immersive experience brought students closer to nature and to each other. Stay tuned for an upcoming interview that will offer further insights into the rope course adventure. This wraps up the enviro-week update.</h2>

        <h1>Fun fact of the day: Did you know that the largest mountain/volcano is not Mt. Everest? It is actually a volcano in Hawaii, which is over 30,000 feet from base height to the top. Mt. Everest is only about 6,500 feet, measuring from the base to the top! It's only considered the tallest mountain because of the location of its base. The base of Mt. Everest is very tall! </h1>

            <h1>NBA (Basketball)
 NBA games are always packed with action! Stars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Anthony Edwards are scoring big points, and there have been some unbelievable dunks. The Celtics recently pulled off a major comeback win! And the Oklahoma City Thunder (OKC) are on an unbelievable historic pace in the 2025-26 NBA season, matching the best 25-game start ever (24-1) and are widely seen as legitimate contenders to break the Golden State Warriors' 73-9 record, showcasing dominant play with record-setting margins of victory and high net ratings. Who do you think will make it to the playoffs this year?
