            <h2>In this edition, we provide a vivid review of Enviro-Week. Picture this: The rhythmic sound of paddles cutting through the water as students kayaked under the clear blue sky, the air filled with excitement and camaraderie. For the eighth-grade students, the ropes course offered an unforgettable challenge. Imagine the thrill of their voices as they encouraged one another from the treetops, a symphony of laughter and determination. This immersive experience brought students closer to nature and to each other. Stay tuned for an upcoming interview that will offer further insights into the rope course adventure. This wraps up the enviro-week update.</h2>

            <h1>Fun fact of the day: Did you know that the largest mountain/volcano is not Mt. Everest? It is actually a volcano in Hawaii, which is over 30,000 feet from base height to the top. Mt. Everest is only about 6,500 feet, measuring from the base to the top! It's only considered the tallest mountain because of where the base is located. The base of Mt. Everest is very tall! </h1>
